Java:
- Java is a programming language and a platform.
- Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
- Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform.
  Since Java has its own runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called platform.

--> What is Java?
- Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.
- It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

--> It is used for:

- Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Web servers and application servers
- Games
- Database connection
  And much, much more!

--> Why Use Java?
- Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world.
- It has a large demand in the current job market.
- It is easy to learn and simple to use.
- It is open-source and free.
- It is secure, fast and powerful.
- It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers).
- Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code
  to be reused, lowering development costs.
- As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa.

--> If you want to run any Java program, you need to install the JRE by downloading it from the internet.
- JDK = JRE + Development tools (compiler, etc.)
- JRE = JVM + Library classes

Java Development Kit
It is a set of software tools and libraries that the developer use to compile and run 
java applications and applets.

Java Runtime Environment
It is a physical implementation of JVM. 
It contains libraries and other files that JVM uses at runtime.

Java Virtual Machine
It is an abstract machine that doesn't physcially exist. 
It provides a run time environment in which java bytecode can be executed.

--> Features of Java
1. Object Oriented
2. Platform Independent
3. Secured
4. Abstract neutral and portable
5. Multi threaded
6. Robust
7. High performance and low cost
